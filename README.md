This example demonstrates an uncommon HTML/JavaScript bug related to DOM manipulation.  The bug occurs when attempting to access the textContent of a DOM element after it has been removed from the DOM, even if it was previously hidden using display: none.  This can lead to unexpected errors, particularly in older or less-conformant browsers. The solution shows how to avoid this issue by performing the text content access *before* removing the element.
